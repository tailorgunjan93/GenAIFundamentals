## 🤖 Welcome to the OpenAI Agents SDK Playground!

This folder demonstrates how to build, configure, and run intelligent agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK. You'll learn how to set up your environment, create agent models, and orchestrate complex tasks with ease—all in a modern, notebook-driven workflow.

---

## ✨ What You'll Learn
- **Agent Creation**: How to define and configure agents for different tasks.
- **Async Model Integration**: Use `AsyncOpenAI` for fast, non-blocking API calls.
- **Flexible Model Selection**: Easily switch between models (e.g., Gemini Flash) and endpoints.
- **Trace & Debug**: Use tracing tools to monitor agent execution and results.
- **Best Practices**: Securely manage API keys, modularize your code, and keep your workflow reproducible.

---

## 📂 Folder Highlights
- `FirstPractice.ipynb` — Step-by-step notebook for building and running your first agent.
- *(Add your own agent experiments!)*

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**: Use `uv` or `pip` to install the required packages (see your environment setup).
2. **Set up your `.env` file**: Store your API keys and secrets securely.
3. **Open the notebook**: Launch `FirstPractice.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter.
4. **Run the cells**: Follow the guided code and markdown to create, configure, and run your agent.

## 🛠️ Example .env File
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices
- **Check your imports**: Make sure all classes/functions you import from `agents` exist in your SDK version.
- **Use async for speed**: The `AsyncOpenAI` client lets you run multiple agent tasks in parallel.
- **Trace for insight**: Use the `trace` context manager to debug and visualize agent runs.
- **Stay modular**: Keep config, agent logic, and API keys separate for maintainability.
